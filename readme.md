Block Rotation Animation
This JavaScript code creates a simple animation of a rotating block. The animation is achieved by continuously rotating a square block element using CSS transformations.

Description
The code creates a <div> element representing a block with a blue background. It then applies CSS styles to position the block at the center of the screen and sets its initial rotation angle.

A function called animateBlock() is defined to handle the animation. This function is called recursively using requestAnimationFrame() to continuously update the rotation angle and apply it to the block's style.

Usage
To use this code, simply include it in your HTML file within a <script> tag, or save it as index.js and link it in your HTML file using a <script> tag.

Example
You can see this animation in action by running the code in a web browser. Once executed, a blue square block will appear on the screen and start rotating continuously.
